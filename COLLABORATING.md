# Collaborating

Since you are here, I am really interested in creating a meta repository that when downloaded for the millionth 
time will make a lot of noise and throw confetti around (ah, bedtime).

I'm sure somebody is already working on that though.  The millionth and one download will make (uh, GNU make) 
you very impressed methinks.  I think I know how to do this but I am stuck on the namespace collisions.

### Guidelines

1. I would rather a failing test and then the changes to make it pass (BDD)
2. You don't have to be nice but if you are please mean it
