# Greetings (👋🏾)


I like vms and languages. (English makes me scream)

All of this stuff is a work in progress.

I like design and automation, too.

Might not ever get around to those, at the slow pace...

I (do not) enjoy security and networking.

- Elijah - https://github.com/elijah-tng/

### Writing work emails on leave with pay

### Previous Interest List (no real progress)

- local-first version control
- local-first system updates (should have been done already)

### Actual interests

- Networking and virtualisation
- Languages and the interaction with hardware, esp I. nets, medley/open-genera, consoles
