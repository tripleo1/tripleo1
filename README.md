# Greetings (👋🏾)


I like vms and languages (read smalltalk).

All of this stuff is a work in progress.

I like design and automation, too.

  (should archive: finish the fluffy experiment)
  (working on cr+ep combination, alternative frontends need scripts I don't want to write)
- Elijah - https://github.com/elijah-tng/
  (plugins: maven (low prio), apt is out of style (similarly), giving up for leiningen/sbt!/\[??\])
- Jnode-revisited - https://github.com/jnode-revisited/
  (would like to build completely offline (also the heritage thing))

### I care about these

- passkeys, etc
- pv (the russian thing)
- xen (something about can't allocate memory)
- medley, open-genera, guile
- multi-kernel
- vnc\* vs spice (lxd, lima/micro)


### VMs

- all the obvious ones (bs,br,...)
- bs fit
- ...


### Debian

- (regolith is nice/decent)
- dget ---build apt.bc/...dsc can be a bit much
- scripts (arch-install-scripts) and docs are all over the place (same ol' thing)


### Interesting things to move to a blog or something (no indication of priority)

- local-first version control
- local-first system updates (backlogged; go thingy)
- Networking and virtualisation
- Languages and the interaction with hardware, esp I. nets, sss
- multi-kernel
- Yeah right Verilog
- turning everything into plan 9
- super duper ai assistant
- kubernetes and or building docker containers with new and exciting tools


### Interesting things to move to a blog or something 

- making it look pretty (antlr-web for one)
