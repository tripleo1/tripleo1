# Hey there, hey there! 👋🏾

I like putting things together and taking them apart *.

This is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because you are looking at it.
I am honored.

No, seriously.  Read some stuff that I wrote:

* [My Blog](https://tripleo1.github.io/)

I didn't write this:

* [Systems Software Research is Irrelevant (aka utah2000 or utah2k)](http://doc.cat-v.org/bell_labs/utah2000/utah2000.html)

### Topics at hand

- 🌱 I’m currently learning the meaning of the things I never knew
- 💬 Ask me constructive questions that _answer my questions_
- 😄 Pronouns are used instead of names

- 🔭 I’m currently working on a project that will fix any bug that you triage
- 👯 I am [looking to collaborate](COLLABORATING.md) on making this a worthwhile endeavor for the both of us and anyone that comes after
- 🤔 I’m looking for the reason why ZFS is so controversial

- ⚡⚡ Fun fact: None of my code works!
- 👯👯 More funner: Yours might, send a PR!
- 😄 Numbers are used instead of pronouns
