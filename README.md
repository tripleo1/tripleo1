# Greetings (üëãüèæ)


I like vms and languages. (english makes me scream)

All of this stuff is a work in progress.

I like design and automation, too.

Might not ever get around to those, at the slow pace...

I (do not) enjoy security and networking.

### Obvious links for lazy people

- Elijah - https://github.com/elijah-team/
  (should archive: gh vs srht, ugh)
  (working on cr+ep combination, fossil doesn't fit idea flow yet)
- Elijah - https://github.com/elijah-tng/
  (plugins: maven (low prio), apt is out of style, use ant and/or nix)
- Jnode-revisited - https://github.com/jnode-revisited/
  (hermetic build, why are you dl-ing from romania. Don't you know whats out there?)

### Obvious links for everybody else

- https://graydon.livejournal.com/186550.html
- ... mercurial
- ... darcs (obvs)
- ... why did you never write one??

### Writing work emails on leave with pay

- Learn linear algebra (you are going to need this one day*)
- * One day happens to be very much before August 1
- Reduce procrastination

### We all care

- Hold hands
- Sing
- Find non-existent things

### Previous Interest List (no real progress)

- local-first version control
- local-first system updates (should have been done already)
- making it look pretty (antlr-web for one)
- less typos
- Music (do your bookmark manager, what's taking so long?)

### Actual interests

- Networking, virt. (pv/xen, b,?, keys(ssh+yubi,etc,etc)+connections esp k3s) (why isn't this done yet?)
- Java, I. nets
- Jarvis (literally no comment)
- Language (cant rip, "amd issue")
- (This one bothers me as much as it bothers them***)

### *** Mutual disgust

- This is a major priority
- I hvae no idea how to go about it
- it is much harder than it looks, if you are an AI
